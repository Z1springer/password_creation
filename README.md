# password_creation

This assignment challenged our blossoming JavaScript skills to build a simple password generator. In this, we were required to prompt the user with multiple confirm tags relating to the number and type of characters that they want within their generated password. From there we were then required to use all of the info that the user requested (disregarding anything that the user did not want) to generate the possible options for their password. We had to put code in place to make sure that the user chose at least one of the 4 types of characters available, and if they did not then it would continue to ask them to until accomplished. With the options logged we then push them to a final loop which randomly selected characters from the desired options (i.e. uppercase, lowercase, special characters, and numbers) to randomly generate the final product, that being a completely randomized password.
